# Agent Workflow Rules

## Commit and Push Policy
- For any file change task, create commits in small logical units instead of one large commit.
- Commit message titles must be in English and must start with an emoji.
- Push commits to `origin` after the task is completed unless the user explicitly says not to push.
- Apply this policy automatically on repeated requests; do not wait for another reminder.
